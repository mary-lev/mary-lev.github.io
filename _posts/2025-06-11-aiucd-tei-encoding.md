I presented the LeggoManzoni case study at AIUCD-2025 (The 14th Annual Conference of the Association of Digital Humanities and Digital Culture) in Verona, Italy. This presentation, co-authored with Beatrice Nava and Ersilia Russo, demonstrated how TEI encoding can serve as a unified structure for multilingual digital editions.

## Research Context

The presentation addressed a key challenge in digital scholarly editing: how to create coherent, interoperable multilingual editions that maintain scholarly standards while enabling computational analysis and user interaction.

## The LeggoManzoni Project

LeggoManzoni is a comprehensive digital edition project centered on Alessandro Manzoni's "I Promessi Sposi" (The Betrothed), featuring:

- **Multiple language versions**: Italian original and various translations
- **Critical apparatus**: Scholarly annotations and commentary
- **Interactive features**: Enhanced reading experience with digital tools
- **Educational focus**: Resources for teaching Italian literature

## TEI Implementation Strategy

Our approach demonstrates how TEI encoding can:

### Unify Multiple Texts
- **Parallel structure**: Consistent encoding across different language versions
- **Alignment markers**: Linking corresponding passages between texts
- **Hierarchical organization**: Maintaining textual relationships at multiple levels

### Support Multilingual Features
- **Language identification**: Proper markup for different languages and dialects
- **Translation relationships**: Explicit connections between source and target texts
- **Cultural annotations**: Context-sensitive explanatory materials

### Enable Computational Analysis
- **Structured data**: Machine-readable format for text mining and analysis
- **Standardized markup**: Interoperability with digital humanities tools
- **Extensible framework**: Capacity for future enhancements and additions

## Technical Innovations

The project showcases several advances in TEI practice:
- **Modular design**: Reusable components for different texts and languages
- **Validation frameworks**: Quality assurance for complex multilingual markup
- **Publishing workflows**: From TEI source to multiple output formats

## Broader Implications

This work contributes to:
- **Digital edition methodology**: Best practices for multilingual projects
- **TEI development**: Extending standards for complex use cases
- **Cultural heritage**: Preserving and presenting literary works digitally
- **Educational technology**: Tools for literature teaching and learning

## Publication

The full paper is available with detailed technical specifications and case study analysis, providing a replicable model for similar multilingual digital edition projects.

The LeggoManzoni project exemplifies how rigorous encoding standards can support both scholarly research and public engagement with literary heritage.
