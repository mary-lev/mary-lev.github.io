![Handwritten Text Recognition](https://github.com/mary-lev/mary-lev.github.io/blob/32bd95bd10a05ca9cb3ffa3be752612223abc6cf/assets/img/HTR.jpg)
I recently presented at the University of Bologna's seminar on "Machine Learning for Art and Humanities." My presentation focused on handwritten text recognition (HTR), going over the HTR pipeline and looking at what's currently being done in this area.

Here are <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1aEcRFIMhzlfjy3Yq-o9tc-Gi-IPLwHsK?usp=sharing">two main HTR pipeline steps simplified with Google Colab</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mary-lev/HTR_demo">some data</a> and <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/handwritten-text-recognition-for-manuscripts-and-early-printed-texts/267679039">the slides</a>.
