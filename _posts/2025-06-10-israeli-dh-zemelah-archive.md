I presented my work on the Zemelah.online digital archive at the Israeli International Conference on Digital Humanities and Social Sciences at The Open University of Israel in Ra'anana. The presentation focused on advanced digital methods for organizing and accessing Soviet-era Jewish egodocuments.

## Project Overview

Zemelah.online is a digital archive of Soviet-era Jewish egodocuments that combines traditional archival methods with cutting-edge computational approaches to enhance discoverability and user interaction with historical materials.

## Technical Components

The project integrates three main computational approaches:

### Subject Indexing
- **Automated classification**: Using NLP techniques to categorize documents by topic
- **Semantic tagging**: Identifying key themes and concepts across the collection
- **Multilingual processing**: Handling documents in multiple languages (Russian, Yiddish, Hebrew)

### Chatbot Interface
- **Natural language queries**: Allowing users to ask questions about the archive in natural language
- **Context-aware responses**: Providing relevant document suggestions based on user interests
- **Educational support**: Helping researchers and students navigate the collection

### Computational Text Analysis
- **Named entity recognition**: Identifying people, places, and organizations
- **Temporal analysis**: Tracking changes in themes and language over time
- **Network analysis**: Mapping relationships between documents and entities

## Research Significance

This work addresses several important challenges:
- **Accessibility**: Making historical documents more discoverable
- **Preservation**: Ensuring cultural heritage materials remain accessible
- **Research support**: Providing tools for scholars studying Soviet Jewish history
- **Public engagement**: Making archives accessible to broader audiences

## Methodological Innovation

The project demonstrates how:
- AI can enhance traditional archival practice
- Computational methods can support humanities research
- Digital tools can preserve and present cultural heritage
- Interdisciplinary collaboration enriches both fields

## Impact

The Zemelah.online project serves as a model for:
- Digital archive development
- Computational humanities applications
- Cultural heritage preservation
- Public history initiatives

This work contributes to the broader field of digital humanities by showing how advanced computational methods can make historical collections more accessible while preserving their scholarly integrity.
