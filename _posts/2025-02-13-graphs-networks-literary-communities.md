I presented my research on literary communities at the Graphs & Networks Conference 2025 at Università della Svizzera italiana in Mendrisio, Switzerland. This presentation explored the application of graph theory and network analysis to understand literary community formation and evolution.

## Conference Context

The Graphs & Networks Conference brings together researchers from various disciplines who apply network analysis methods to complex systems. This interdisciplinary venue was ideal for presenting literary network analysis to a broader scientific community.

## Research Overview

The study examined how literary communities in Saint Petersburg formed, evolved, and dissolved over a 20-year period (1999-2019) using graph-theoretic approaches applied to cultural data.

## Network Analysis Methods

The research employed several network analysis techniques:

- **Community detection algorithms**: Identifying clusters of closely connected literary actors
- **Centrality measures**: Determining influential nodes in the literary network
- **Temporal network analysis**: Tracking changes in community structure over time
- **Homophily analysis**: Examining how similar actors tend to connect

## Key Findings

The analysis revealed:
- **Distinct literary communities**: Separate clusters based on genre, generation, and aesthetic preferences
- **Bridge figures**: Individuals who connected different literary circles
- **Temporal dynamics**: How communities merged, split, and reformed over time
- **Structural patterns**: Common organizational principles in literary networks

## Methodological Innovation

This work demonstrates how:
- Graph theory can illuminate cultural phenomena
- Literary data can be analyzed using network science methods
- Temporal analysis reveals community evolution patterns
- Interdisciplinary approaches enrich literary studies

## Broader Implications

The research contributes to:
- Understanding cultural network dynamics
- Developing methods for analyzing literary communities
- Bridging humanities and network science
- Providing tools for cultural policy and literary history

The work showcases how computational methods can offer new insights into traditional humanities questions while respecting the complexity of cultural phenomena.
