## Upcoming Presentation

I will be presenting my research on Saint Petersburg's literary ecosystem at the 4th Annual Conference of Computational Literary Studies 2025 in Krakow, Poland. This study analyzes 20 years of literary community formation through a unique computational approach based on cultural event participation.

## Research Overview

Rather than studying literary networks through texts or correspondence, this research examines how literary communities form through shared participation in cultural events â€” readings, book launches, discussions, and festivals. Using data from the SPbLitGuide newsletter (1999-2019), the study maps the social structure of Saint Petersburg's literary world during a crucial period of post-Soviet cultural transformation.

The study processes **15,012 cultural events** involving **11,777 participants** across **862 venues**, creating a network based on event co-participation. Participants who attend events together are connected in the network, with edge weights adjusted for event size (smaller gatherings indicate stronger connections).

## Major Findings

### Network Structure
- **10,656 participants** connected by **106,127 relationships**
- **49 distinct communities** identified through algorithmic analysis
- High clustering coefficient (0.753) indicates tight local groups
- Several communities map precisely onto known aesthetic schools (experimental avant-garde, literary traditionalists, "new prose" movement)

### Historical Periods
1. **Post-Soviet transformation (1999-2009)**: Integration of unofficial literature into public visibility
2. **Commercial expansion (2010-2013)**: Dramatic growth in venues and events, rise of bookstore chains as cultural spaces  
3. **Economic adaptation (2014-2019)**: Resilience despite economic pressures, diversification of venue types

### Spatial Patterns
- **Geographic concentration** in Saint Petersburg's historic center
- **Community-specific venue preferences**: experimental poets favor alternative spaces, traditionalists use established institutions
- **Career trajectories** visible through authors' migration from alternative to mainstream venues

## Methodological Innovation

This **event-based approach** offers unique advantages:
- Captures **ephemeral interactions** that leave few textual traces
- Reveals **hidden figures** (organizers, moderators) essential to literary networks
- Maps **concrete geographies** and temporal rhythms of literary engagement
- Documents **actual participation patterns** rather than declared affiliations

## Historical Significance

The dataset covers the **last decades of predominantly offline literary life** in Saint Petersburg before digital and geopolitical disruptions of 2020-2022, preserving a crucial record of cultural practices that have since been fundamentally transformed.
