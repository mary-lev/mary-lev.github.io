## Upcoming Presentation

I will be presenting my comprehensive study of literary communities at the 4th Annual Conference of Computational Literary Studies 2025 in Krakow, Poland. This presentation will detail the event-based social network analysis of Saint Petersburg's literary landscape from 1999 to 2019.

## Conference Significance

The Conference of Computational Literary Studies brings together researchers at the intersection of literary studies and computational methods, making it the ideal venue for presenting work that bridges traditional literary scholarship with quantitative analysis.

## Research Methodology

This study will employ event-based social network analysis, a novel approach that:

### Event-Centered Analysis
- **Events as network nodes**: Literary events serve as connection points between actors
- **Temporal dynamics**: Tracking how events create and maintain community ties
- **Institutional mapping**: Understanding the role of venues and organizations

### Network Construction
- **Bipartite networks**: Connecting people to events and events to people
- **Temporal layers**: Analyzing network evolution across different time periods
- **Multi-dimensional analysis**: Considering different types of connections and relationships

## Data and Scope

The research utilized:
- **20 years of data**: SPbLitGuide newsletters from 1999-2019
- **Thousands of events**: Literary readings, book launches, conferences, workshops
- **Diverse participants**: Authors, critics, publishers, cultural institutions
- **Multiple venues**: From major cultural centers to small literary cafes

## Expected Findings

The analysis is expected to reveal:

### Community Structure
- **Distinct literary circles**: Different aesthetic and generational communities
- **Cross-community bridges**: Events and individuals connecting separate groups
- **Hierarchical organization**: Core and peripheral participants in the literary field

### Temporal Evolution
- **Cyclical patterns**: Seasonal and annual rhythms in literary activity
- **Historical transitions**: How political and economic changes affected literary networks
- **Generational shifts**: Evolution of literary communities over time

### Institutional Role
- **Venue importance**: How specific locations shaped literary community formation
- **Organizational influence**: The role of cultural institutions in network structure
- **Event types**: Different kinds of literary events and their network effects

## Methodological Contributions

This work advances computational literary studies by:
- **Event-based modeling**: New approaches to understanding cultural networks
- **Temporal network analysis**: Methods for studying community evolution
- **Cultural data processing**: Techniques for analyzing humanities data
- **Interdisciplinary methods**: Bridging network science and literary studies

## Broader Impact

The research demonstrates:
- How computational methods can illuminate literary history
- The value of long-term cultural data analysis
- New possibilities for understanding creative communities
- The importance of local cultural ecosystems

## Publication Plans

The full paper will be submitted to the Journal of Computational Literary Studies, providing detailed methodology and comprehensive results that can inform future research in computational approaches to literary community analysis.
