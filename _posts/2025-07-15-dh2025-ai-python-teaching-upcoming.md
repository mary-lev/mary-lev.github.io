## Upcoming Presentation

I will be presenting "AI-Supported Scaffolded Learning for Teaching Python in Digital Humanities Education" at the ADHO Digital Humanities Conference 2025 in Lisbon, Portugal.

## Research Focus

This presentation will explore how artificial intelligence can enhance the teaching of programming skills in digital humanities contexts, specifically focusing on Python programming instruction.

## Key Topics to Address

### AI-Supported Learning Framework
- **Scaffolded approach**: Progressive skill-building with AI assistance
- **Adaptive feedback**: Personalized guidance based on student progress
- **Error analysis**: AI-powered identification and explanation of common programming mistakes

### Digital Humanities Context
- **Domain-specific examples**: Programming exercises using humanities data and problems
- **Cultural computing applications**: Projects that connect coding skills to humanities research
- **Interdisciplinary integration**: Bridging technical skills and humanities scholarship

### Pedagogical Innovation
- **Student-centered design**: Methods that accommodate diverse learning backgrounds
- **Interactive learning environments**: Tools that provide immediate feedback and support
- **Assessment strategies**: Evaluating both technical skills and humanities applications

## Research Questions

The presentation will address:
- How can AI tools effectively support novice programmers in humanities contexts?
- What scaffolding strategies work best for teaching Python to humanities students?
- How do we balance technical skill development with humanities research goals?
- What are the ethical considerations in AI-assisted programming education?

## Expected Contributions

### Methodological
- Novel approaches to programming pedagogy in humanities contexts
- Integration strategies for AI tools in digital humanities education
- Assessment frameworks for technical skills in humanities programs

### Practical
- Concrete tools and techniques for DH educators
- Replicable course design models
- Open educational resources for Python in DH

## Broader Implications

This work contributes to:
- **Digital humanities pedagogy**: Advancing teaching methods in the field
- **Programming education**: Adapting CS education for humanities contexts
- **AI in education**: Exploring beneficial applications of AI in learning
- **Interdisciplinary education**: Supporting students working across disciplines

## Conference Relevance

The ADHO Digital Humanities Conference is the premier venue for discussing innovations in digital humanities education, making it ideal for sharing research on effective programming instruction in humanities contexts.

## Future Directions

The presentation will outline:
- Plans for empirical evaluation of the proposed methods
- Collaboration opportunities with other DH educators
- Development of open-source educational tools
- Integration with existing DH curricula
