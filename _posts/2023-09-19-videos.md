Last week at Cubo Gruppo Unipol, together with Giulia Menna and Beatrice Nava, I presented the first release version of Leggo Manzoni, a project developed with the University of Bologna and the Advanced Research Centre for Digital Humanities (DH.arc). Speaking three minutes in Italian was even harder for me than writing all the code for the project in Node.JS.
