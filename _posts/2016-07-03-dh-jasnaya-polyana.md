[The first Moscow-Tartu School in Digital Humanities](https://www.hse.ru/en/news/187080293.html) recently convened at the Leo Tolstoy House and Museum in Yasnaya Polyana. This event aimed to foster an interdisciplinary academic setting where contemporary computing techniques are utilized for textual analysis. Organized collaboratively by the HSE School of Linguistics, the Leo Tolstoy House and Museum in Yasnaya Polyana, and the Department of Russian Literature at the University of Tartu, the school marked a significant step in integrating modern technology with literary studies.

I conducted a tutorial on computational literary analysis. The sessions, held on July 5th and 6th, focused on foundational poetics, use of Concordances.ru, and practical exercises in distributive semantics and word2vec. The tutorial was designed to equip participants with the skills to analyze literary texts digitally, emphasizing semantic and stylistic features, particularly in poetry. We also delved into advanced topics like motif analysis and language evolution, highlighting the role of digital tools in literary studies.
