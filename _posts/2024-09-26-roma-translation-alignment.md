I participated in the workshop "Aligned Translations for Digital Scholarly Editions: Methodologies, Methods, and Workflows" at the Istituto Italiano di Studi Germanici in Rome, presenting my work on the alignment challenges in multilingual digital editions.

## Presentation Focus

The presentation examined both manual and automatic approaches to aligning different versions and translations of Alessandro Manzoni's "I Promessi Sposi" (The Betrothed), discussing the practical challenges and theoretical implications of creating aligned multilingual digital editions.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Manual alignment workflows**: Traditional philological approaches adapted for digital environments
- **Automatic alignment pipelines**: Computational methods for text alignment across languages and editions
- **Quality assessment**: Comparing manual and automatic alignment results
- **Open challenges**: Remaining issues in multilingual digital edition creation

## Technical Challenges

The work highlighted several persistent challenges in translation alignment:
- Handling different text structures across languages
- Managing varying levels of textual correspondence
- Balancing accuracy with processing efficiency
- Integrating alignment data into TEI-compliant formats

## Workshop Context

This workshop brought together scholars working on multilingual digital editions, providing a valuable forum for discussing methodological approaches and sharing practical solutions for common challenges in the field.

The research contributes to the broader LeggoManzoni project, which aims to create comprehensive multilingual digital editions with integrated critical apparatus.
