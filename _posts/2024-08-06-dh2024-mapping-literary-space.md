I presented my research on literary communities at the ADHO Digital Humanities Conference 2024 at George Mason University in Washington, DC. The presentation focused on mapping the social literary network in Saint Petersburg from 1999 to 2019 using social network analysis within the digital humanities framework.

## Research Overview

This study analyzes the cultural landscape of Saint Petersburg through the lens of social network analysis, examining how literary events and cultural activities create connections between writers, critics, and cultural institutions over two decades.

## Methodology

The research is based on data extracted from SPbLitGuide newsletters, which documented literary events in Saint Petersburg from 1999 to 2019. Using network analysis techniques, I mapped the relationships between:

- Literary venues and institutions
- Authors and their collaborative networks  
- Cultural events and their participants
- Temporal patterns in literary community formation

## Key Findings

The analysis revealed distinct patterns in how Saint Petersburg's literary community evolved over the studied period, highlighting the role of specific venues, events, and individuals in shaping the city's cultural landscape.
