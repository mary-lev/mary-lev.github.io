The paper for the ["Corpus Linguistics-2015"](https://events.spbu.ru/events/archive/corpora-2015/program.html) conference on June 22-26, 2015 (Saint Petersburg) introduces a system for organizing and marking up a corpus of Russian poetic texts, aimed at linguistic and literary research applications.

The work centers on the "Concordances 2.0" project, detailing a multi-level markup scheme for poetic texts, addressing complex cases, and exploring its applications. The presentation emphasized the evolution of markup principles in computer science since the 1960s and their role in computational semantics.

Key topics included the synergy between manual and automatic markup, the importance of accurate text representation in a corpus, and the integration of various levels of language analysis. The project's approach, using the TEI markup language, facilitates comprehensive statistical and contextual analysis of Russian poetry, enhancing both linguistic study and literary interpretation.
