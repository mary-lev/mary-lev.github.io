**EU Export Sanctions Analysis** is a comprehensive data analysis platform examining export-import discrepancies under EU sanctions against Russia. This Streamlit-based application provides interactive tools for detecting anomalous trade patterns and potential sanctions circumvention through intermediary countries.

## üéØ Research Context

Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the European Union implemented extensive sanctions to suppress the Russian economy and limit its ability to finance aggressive actions. However, questions about sanctions effectiveness have emerged as Russia appears to circumvent measures through neighboring countries and trade rerouting.

This project provides empirical analysis to verify claims of growing intermediary trade and quantify the scale of potential sanctions circumvention using official statistical data.

## üí° Research Inspiration

The project was inspired by **Robin Brooks'** observations highlighting unusual export growth from EU countries to regions such as Kyrgyzstan and Armenia. Brooks' insights raised critical questions about:

- **Significant growth patterns** in import/export activities with intermediary countries
- **Data alignment** between EU sources (Eurostat) and local statistical agencies
- **Statistical significance** of trade changes post-February 2022

## üîç Research Questions

### Primary Objectives
1. **Trend Analysis**: What changes occurred in EU imports/exports since February 2022, particularly through intermediary countries?
2. **Statistical Significance**: Are observed changes statistically significant and linked to sanctions timeline?
3. **Data Verification**: How well does EU data match with open data from Kyrgyzstan and Russia?
4. **Circumvention Detection**: What discrepancies exist that could indicate sanctions evasion?

### Analytical Goals
- **Historical Baseline Detection**: Establish pre-sanctions trade patterns
- **Anomaly Identification**: Detect unusual post-2022 trade behaviors
- **Trade Redirection Quantification**: Measure extent of trade rerouting
- **Intermediary Role Analysis**: Assess specific countries' involvement in trade redirection

## üìä Key Findings

### Anomalous Export Growth (EU to Intermediary Countries)

| Country | Growth Rate | Geopolitical Context |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Kyrgyzstan** | **+344.8%** | EAEU member, close Russia ties |
| **Armenia** | **+148.9%** | EAEU member, regional hub |
| **Trinidad and Tobago** | **+122.6%** | Caribbean trade gateway |
| **Kazakhstan** | **+88.6%** | Major Central Asian economy |
| **Uzbekistan** | **+63.8%** | Regional economic partner |

### Statistical Significance
- **Timeline Correlation**: Trade surges align precisely with sanctions implementation
- **Magnitude Assessment**: Growth rates far exceed historical variations
- **Geopolitical Patterns**: Countries with strong Russia ties show highest increases
- **Economic Logic**: Trade volumes inconsistent with domestic consumption capacity
