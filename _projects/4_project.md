**Historical OCR Analysis** is a comprehensive web application for analyzing and visualizing OCR model performance on 18th century Russian Civil Font documents. This tool provides detailed insights into how modern Large Language Models handle historical text recognition challenges.

## üéØ Research Context

This application supports the research paper **"Why and Where LLMs Still Go Wrong: Gaps in Historical Linguistic Competence"** by providing an interactive platform to explore OCR errors and model performance across a dataset of 1,029 historical Russian documents from 1752-1801.

## üìä Dataset Overview

### Scale and Scope
- **1,029 images** from **428 books** 
- **Time Period**: 1752-1801 (18th century Russian Civil Font)
- **Content Coverage**: 28,662 text lines, 933K characters
- **Subject Distribution**: Fiction, science, religion, history, geography, drama, education, poetry
- **Difficulty Range**: Easy to hard, with majority classified as medium difficulty

### Historical Significance
- **Peak Coverage**: 1780s-1790s representing golden age of Russian literature
- **Civil Font**: Transition period from Church Slavonic to modern Russian typography
- **Literary Genres**: Comprehensive coverage of 18th century Russian literary production

## üîß Key Features

### Analysis View (Dataset-Wide Insights)
- **Comprehensive Statistics**: Overview of 428 books and temporal distribution
- **Performance Metrics**: Model comparison with top-3 highlighting across evaluation metrics
- **Error Analysis**: Detailed breakdown of character substitutions and foreign character insertions
- **Subject Analysis**: Performance patterns across different literary genres

### Document View (Individual Analysis)
- **Interactive Image Viewer**: Zoom, pan, click-to-select with ALTO XML overlay
- **Line-by-Line Comparison**: Ground truth vs. model outputs
- **Smart Model Comparison**: 3-column layout with intelligent line matching
- **Real-Time Metrics**: Character preservation, case sensitivity, word accuracy

## ü§ñ Models Evaluated

The platform analyzes performance across **12 state-of-the-art language models**:

### OpenAI Family
- GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, O3, O4-mini

### Google Family

### Alibaba
- Qwen 2.5 VL

## üîç Key Research Findings

### Historical Character Preservation
- **Gemini models** demonstrate superior preservation of historical Russian characters (—£, —ñ, —ä)
- **Character-specific challenges**: Old orthography poses consistent difficulties across model families

### Performance Hierarchy
- **Latest generation models** show 5-15% accuracy improvements over earlier versions
- **Model family differences**: Distinct strengths in different aspects of historical text processing

### Error Pattern Analysis
- **Case sensitivity** remains a primary challenge across all models
- **Foreign character insertion** shows systematic patterns
- **Dataset complexity**: 880 medium difficulty and 146 hard documents provide substantial OCR challenges

## üíª Technology Stack
