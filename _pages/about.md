## Maria: The Digital Alchemist of the Humanities

Equal parts code whisperer and literary detective, Maria is a master's graduate from the University of Bologna who dances seamlessly between AI algorithms and 19th-century novels. By day, she builds intelligent learning systems that guide students through Python with scaffolded support. By night, she decodes the soul of Russian poetry using Word2Vec and aligns multilingual digital editions of *I promessi sposi* with scholarly precision.

She's turned historical OCR into a streamlined pipeline, made TEI sing in a web interface, and brought literary communities to life through social network analysis. Fluent in Python, English, Italian, and Russian (and probably dreaming in regex), Maria can just as easily debug a deployment pipeline as explain semantic drift in amateur poetry.
