Zemelah.online is a digital archive preserving and analyzing Soviet-era Jewish egodocuments. Our collection encompasses diverse material types: handwritten manuscripts, typewritten documents, and small-edition publications produced for family and friends. After digitization, handwritten and typewritten texts undergo OCR/HTR processing with subsequent proofreading.
The project's initial phase focused on developing systematic document processing and qualitative text analysis. We index key entities (locations, persons, organizations) and thematic content covering both Jewish-specific and universal subjects: historical events, religious practices, family relations, professional life, and cultural engagement. This careful indexing enables discovery of narratives from "ordinary" Soviet Jews, revealing diverse experiences that challenge conventional scholarly frameworks â€“ from stories of victimhood to achievement, from acculturation to religious observance.
The project began in late 2020, and since 2023, it has evolved alongside the rapid development of LLMs, significantly shaping its direction. We have expanded our methodological approach, building on our foundation of careful manual indexing. Initially, a markup editor was developed with pre-annotation using Claude and a relatively fixed set of tags. Later, a chatbot powered by GPT was introduced, enabling users to interact with the corpus by asking thematic queries and retrieving relevant text fragments beyond predefined tags.
Our computational analysis of Soviet Jewish narratives employs several complementary approaches. We have completed an extensive topic modeling analysis using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003), following recent applications of this method to historical ego-documents (Thompson et al., 2016),  which identified key patterns in how authors structured their experiences and navigated between private and public spheres. Drawing on methodological advances in computational analysis of historical texts (Graham et al., 2016) and multilingual corpora (McNamee & Mayfield, 2004), we are currently developing additional analytical layers using sentiment analysis and word embeddings (word2vec) to map emotional patterns and semantic relationships across the corpus. This multi-method approach will allow us to examine how specific themes correlate with emotional expression and to visualize the semantic networks that connect different aspects of Soviet Jewish life.
A computational analysis of our corpus demonstrates that there are certain patterns in the documentation and narrativization of Soviet Jewish experiences. The topic modeling of the corpus was based on LDA with several important methodological refinements specifically designed for the analysis of Soviet Jewish memoirs. Rather than using standard stopword lists, we developed a modified set of Russian stopwords to match the specifics of the memoir narratives. The text processing included pymorphy2 for Russian lemmatization. For the LDA model itself, we empirically determined optimal parameters through cross-validation, settling on 8 topics with a document-topic prior (alpha) of 0.1 and a topic-word prior (beta) of 0.01. They were chosen to reflect the complex nature of memoirs, which frequently combine multiple topics.
A topic modeling analysis was conducted, which identified eight distinct thematic clusters (see Figure 1) . The most prevalent theme was Family/Childhood (20.96%), followed by Personal Correspondence and Soviet Jewish Experience.


Figure 1. Topic Distribution in Documents
The correlation analysis (see Figure 2) produced a statistically significant result: a strong negative correlation of -0.32 between Family/Childhood narratives and Soviet Jewish Experience topics. This finding suggests a compelling narrative strategy in which authors tend to separate their intimate family memories from their accounts of institutional and political experiences, effectively creating two distinct modes of storytelling within the corpus.This separation might reflect the complex navigation of private and public spheres that characterized Soviet Jewish life.

Figure 2. Topic Correlation Matrix
The distribution of topics across documents provides additional insights into narrative strategies. Military/Navy Life topics and War/Holocaust narratives, while less frequent overall, tend to appear with high intensity when present. Professional/Medical narratives (showing moderate weights around 0.427) often intersect with institutional experiences, suggesting that career trajectories were closely tied to broader Soviet Jewish experiences. These patterns demonstrate how authors navigated between personal histories and larger social-historical contexts in their memoirs.
In this presentation, we will share the results of our topic modeling analysis, discuss our ongoing work with sentiment and semantic analysis through word embeddings, and demonstrate how these computational methods extend our digital archive through AI-powered indexing and an interactive chatbot interface.
